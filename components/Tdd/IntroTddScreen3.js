              The goal of software tests is to catch any errors before making that software widely
              available. By writing tests first, youâ€™re laying out a detailed roadmap for what an
              ideal version of your code is supposed to accomplish. You let the program tell you
              what to write next.

              Combined with the use of CI/CD and automation, this process can be seamless because
              you're now depending on your tests that decide whether your code are breaking or not
